Requirements of practice 

The API must support basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Open at least 2 Get - 1 Post - 1 Patch - 1 Put - 1 Delete API.

Routing operations should be done as in the example in Weekly Technical Content 5. You can diversify APIs and adjust routes as you wish.

Code the project in English. (Crazy Musicians!)

Make sure that you have carried out the necessary Validation procedures.

Use at least one [FromQuery] structure. Search might be a good example.

During the routing phase, be careful to use the general routing style used in the Galactic Tour application.
